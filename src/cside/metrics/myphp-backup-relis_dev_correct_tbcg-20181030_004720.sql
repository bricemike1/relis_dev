Therefore, modelling and simulation is important for MANETs in order to detect problems that may arise when developing infrastructure solutions. Studies in literature show that simulation tools developed for cable networks have been transformed into MANET tools instead of developing MANET-specific simulation tools. In this paper, a simulation framework for MANETs is designed using the DEVS-Suite simulator tool, which is based on discrete event system specification (DEVS) formalism, and is used for the simulation of cable networks. A specific wireless node architecture for the nodes that form MANETs is developed for a simulation framework. In addition, the new framework includes a topography model to check the velocity and movements of the nodes, packet models roaming in MANET, and visualisation area to observe simulation events.

Therefore, modelling and simulation is important for MANETs in order to detect problems that may arise when developing infrastructure solutions. Studies in literature show that simulation tools developed for cable networks have been transformed into MANET tools instead of developing MANET-specific simulation tools. In this paper, a simulation framework for MANETs is designed using the DEVS-Suite simulator tool, which is based on discrete event system specification (DEVS) formalism, and is used for the simulation of cable networks. A specific wireless node architecture for the nodes that form MANETs is developed for a simulation framework. In addition, the new framework includes a topography model to check the velocity and movements of the nodes, packet models roaming in MANET, and visualisation area to observe simulation events. A coupled model is generated by combining these two models. In addition, an ant colony-based load-balancing scheme is developed to test the model.

To support this claim, in this paper we provide a joint application of two model-driven techniques for physical and cyber-security evaluation. We apply two UML profiles, namely SecAM (for cyber-security) and CIP{\\_}VAM (for physical security), in combination. In such a way, we demonstrate the synergy between both profiles and the need for their tighter integration in the context of a reference case study from the railway domain.","","2015","15",NULL,NULL,"17","2018-09-29 15:46:51","Manually","","Pending","Waiting","0","17_1538250409","3"),

We support our approach with an open-source prototype tool for designing engineering processes, defining inconsistency patterns and their respective management alternatives, and with the ability to optimize the original process for various optimality criteria, such as consistency and costs. {\\textcopyright} 2016, CEUR-WS.

The prediction and verification competence is a must-have ability to allow an efficient and effective design cycle, as much as the complexity of the requirements, in specification, extension or criticalness of the design object, grows. Researchers and practitioners have developed different modeling languages to suit the needs of special classes of problems, such as general formalism like Fault Trees for dependability and availability models, several Petri Nets variants for performance and correctness evaluation, or dedicated modeling languages that map model elements onto domain entities. Richness and variety of formalisms, each of which tailored on a specific problem, empowers the modeling process, but also results in the explosion of many different submodels when coping with a complex and articulated system. These models are logically correlated and are used to take local decisions about single aspects of the overall problem. In practice they might not be aligned to each other and the mutual influences connecting them could be lost, compromising the general results. Multiformalism is an approach to modeling that aims to enable modelers to exploit together different formalisms for different aspects of the same system, while keeping the coherence and the mutual influences of the different parts of the overall model.

The prediction and verification competence is a must-have ability to allow an efficient and effective design cycle, as much as the complexity of the requirements, in specification, extension or criticalness of the design object, grows. Researchers and practitioners have developed different modeling languages to suit the needs of special classes of problems, such as general formalism like Fault Trees for dependability and availability models, several Petri Nets variants for performance and correctness evaluation, or dedicated modeling languages that map model elements onto domain entities. Richness and variety of formalisms, each of which tailored on a specific problem, empowers the modeling process, but also results in the explosion of many different submodels when coping with a complex and articulated system. These models are logically correlated and are used to take local decisions about single aspects of the overall problem. In practice they might not be aligned to each other and the mutual influences connecting them could be lost, compromising the general results. Multiformalism is an approach to modeling that aims to enable modelers to exploit together different formalisms for different aspects of the same system, while keeping the coherence and the mutual influences of the different parts of the overall model.

The hierarchical relationship between the health care delivery system, providers, patients, and other stakeholders exhibits a level of complexity that ought to be captured using dynamic simulation modeling methods. As a tool to help researchers decide whether dynamic simulation modeling is an appropriate method for modeling the effects of an intervention on a health care system, we presented the System, Interactions, Multilevel, Understanding, Loops, Agents, Time, Emergence (SIMULATE) checklist consisting of eight elements. This report builds on the previous work, systematically comparing each of the three most commonly used dynamic simulation modeling methods - system dynamics, discrete-event simulation, and agent-based modeling. We review criteria for selecting the most suitable method depending on 1) the purpose - type of problem and research questions being investigated, 2) the object - scope of the model, and 3) the method to model the object to achieve the purpose. Finally, we provide guidance for emerging good practices for dynamic simulation modeling in the health sector, covering all aspects, from the engagement of decision makers in the model design through model maintenance and upkeep. We conclude by providing some recommendations about the application of these methods to add value to informed decision making, with an emphasis on stakeholder engagement, starting with the problem definition. Finally, we identify areas in which further methodological development will likely occur given the growing \"volume, velocity and variety\" and availability of \"big data\" to provide empirical evidence and techniques such as machine learning for parameter estimation in dynamic simulation models. Upon reviewing this report in addition to using the SIMULATE checklist, the readers should be able to identify whether dynamic simulation modeling methods are appropriate to address the problem at hand and to recognize the differences of these methods from those of other, more traditional modeling approaches such as Markov models and decision trees. This report provides an overview of these modeling methods and examples of health care system problems in which such methods have been useful. The primary aim of the report was to aid decisions as to whether these simulation methods are appropriate to address specific health systems problems.

As a tool to help researchers decide whether dynamic simulation modeling is an appropriate method for modeling the effects of an intervention on a health care system, we presented the System, Interactions, Multilevel, Understanding, Loops, Agents, Time, Emergence (SIMULATE) checklist consisting of eight elements. This report builds on the previous work, systematically comparing each of the three most commonly used dynamic simulation modeling methods - system dynamics, discrete-event simulation, and agent-based modeling. We review criteria for selecting the most suitable method depending on 1) the purpose - type of problem and research questions being investigated, 2) the object - scope of the model, and 3) the method to model the object to achieve the purpose. Finally, we provide guidance for emerging good practices for dynamic simulation modeling in the health sector, covering all aspects, from the engagement of decision makers in the model design through model maintenance and upkeep. We conclude by providing some recommendations about the application of these methods to add value to informed decision making, with an emphasis on stakeholder engagement, starting with the problem definition. Finally, we identify areas in which further methodological development will likely occur given the growing \"volume, velocity and variety\" and availability of \"big data\" to provide empirical evidence and techniques such as machine learning for parameter estimation in dynamic simulation models. Upon reviewing this report in addition to using the SIMULATE checklist, the readers should be able to identify whether dynamic simulation modeling methods are appropriate to address the problem at hand and to recognize the differences of these methods from those of other, more traditional modeling approaches such as Markov models and decision trees. This report provides an overview of these modeling methods and examples of health care system problems in which such methods have been useful. The primary aim of the report was to aid decisions as to whether these simulation methods are appropriate to address specific health systems problems. The report directs readers to other resources for further education on these individual modeling methods for system interventions in the emerging field of health care delivery science and implementation. {\\textcopyright} 2015 Published by Elsevier Inc.","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jval.2015.01.006","2015","91",NULL,NULL,"17","2018-09-29 15:50:28","Manually","","Pending","Waiting","0","17_1538250623","3"),

Many works have been achieved to reduce vulnerabilities in such systems. However, existing methods used to perform security assessment as a holistic approach are still poorly instrumented and limited in scope. In this work, we propose methodology and associated framework for security analysis.

So far, there have been several architecture reference models based on SOA proposed for thing-centric IoT applications. In this paper, we make a comparative analysis on these reference models in terms of component type, design principle and structural characteristics. The results of comparison explain why these reference models are suitable for guiding design of IoT application systems with different scales and requirements.

Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) is currently the most popular architecture style used in guiding development of IoT application systems. So far, there have been several architecture reference models based on SOA proposed for thing-centric IoT applications. In this paper, we make a comparative analysis on these reference models in terms of component type, design principle and structural characteristics. The results of comparison explain why these reference models are suitable for guiding design of IoT application systems with different scales and requirements. We also analyze ways to establish formal models and model check of IoT application systems based on these architecture reference models.

Future research in product line engineering needs to consider an ecosystem of a multitude of stakeholders - e.g., factory component vendors, product designers, factory owners/operators and end-consumers. {\\textcopyright} 2015 ACM.","http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2791060.2791066","2015","188",NULL,NULL,"17","2018-09-29 18:28:01","Manually","","Included","To classify","0","17_1538260079","1"),

This ``roadmap\'\' paper prescribes an approach to modeling based on concurrent communicating components (called actors), where a diversity of orchestration strategies govern the execution and interaction of the components. The prescribed approach has been extensively explored in the Ptolemy Project, but as yet is not widely deployed in engineering practice. The approach achieves interaction between diverse models using an abstract semantics, which is a deliberately incomplete semantics that cannot by itself define a useful modeling framework.

This ``roadmap\'\' paper prescribes an approach to modeling based on concurrent communicating components (called actors), where a diversity of orchestration strategies govern the execution and interaction of the components. The prescribed approach has been extensively explored in the Ptolemy Project, but as yet is not widely deployed in engineering practice. The approach achieves interaction between diverse models using an abstract semantics, which is a deliberately incomplete semantics that cannot by itself define a useful modeling framework.

Along with dedicated initiatives to improve preserving intent comprehensibility in software, such as literate programming, intentional programming, aspect-oriented programming, or the DCI (Data, Context and Interaction) approach, this issue is a subject of contemporary research in the re-revealed area of engaging end users in software development, which has its roots in Alan Kay\'s vision of a personal computer programmable by end users. From the perspective of the reality of complex software system development, the existing approaches are solving the problem of losing intent comprehensibility only partially by a simplified and limited perception of the intent and do this only at the code level. This paper explores the challenges in preserving the intent comprehensibility in software. The thorough treatment of this problem requires a number of techniques and approaches to be engaged, including preserving use cases in the code, dynamic code structuring, executable intent representation using domain specific languages, advanced UML modularization, 3D rendering of UML, and representation and animation of organizational patterns. {\\textcopyright} 2015, Budapest Tech Polytechnical Institution.

In this context, model transformations are crucial for the success of MDE, being comparable in role and importance to compilers for high-level programming languages. Thus, several model transformation approaches have been developed in the last decade, whereby originally most of them are based on the abstract syntax of modeling languages. However, this implementation specific focus makes it difficult for modelers to develop model transformations, because they are familiar with the concrete syntax but not with its computer internal representation. To tackle this problem, model transformation by-example approaches have been proposed which follow the same fundamental idea as query by-example and programming by-example approaches. Instead of using the computer internal representation of models, examples represented in concrete syntax are used to define transformations.

In this context, model transformations are crucial for the success of MDE, being comparable in role and importance to compilers for high-level programming languages. Thus, several model transformation approaches have been developed in the last decade, whereby originally most of them are based on the abstract syntax of modeling languages. However, this implementation specific focus makes it difficult for modelers to develop model transformations, because they are familiar with the concrete syntax but not with its computer internal representation. To tackle this problem, model transformation by-example approaches have been proposed which follow the same fundamental idea as query by-example and programming by-example approaches. Instead of using the computer internal representation of models, examples represented in concrete syntax are used to define transformations. Because different transformation scenarios occur in MDE, different by-example approaches have been developed. This chapter gives an overview on the emerging concepts, techniques, and approaches in this young by-example area. {\\textcopyright} 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-28279-9-15","2012","172",NULL,NULL,"17","2018-09-29 18:28:01","Manually","","Included","To classify","0","17_1538260079","1"),

Software Product Lines (SPLs) aim to support the development of a whole family of software products through systematic reuse of shared assets. As SPLs exhibit a long life-span, evolution is an even greater concern than for single-systems. For the purpose of this work, evolution refers to the adaptation of the SPL as a result of changing requirements. Hence, evolution is triggered by requirement changes, and not by bug fixing or refactoring. OBJECTIVE. Research on SPL evolution has not been previously mapped. This work provides a mapping study along Petersen\'s and Kichenham\'s guidelines, to identify strong areas of knowledge, trends and gaps. RESULTS. We identified 107 relevant contributions.

Software Product Lines (SPLs) aim to support the development of a whole family of software products through systematic reuse of shared assets. As SPLs exhibit a long life-span, evolution is an even greater concern than for single-systems. For the purpose of this work, evolution refers to the adaptation of the SPL as a result of changing requirements. Hence, evolution is triggered by requirement changes, and not by bug fixing or refactoring. OBJECTIVE. Research on SPL evolution has not been previously mapped. This work provides a mapping study along Petersen\'s and Kichenham\'s guidelines, to identify strong areas of knowledge, trends and gaps. RESULTS. We identified 107 relevant contributions. They were classified according to four facets: evolution activity (e.g., identify, analyze and plan, implement), product-derivation approach (e.g., annotation-based, composition-based), research type (e.g., solution, experience, evaluation), and asset type (i.e., variability model, SPL architecture, code assets and products).

This primarily returns to the unpredictability and unrepeatability nature that characterises such process. Traditional modelling approaches are too rigid and do not effectively support the flexibility and dynamicity required by emergency response process.

The context for the presented research is provided by the INTER-IoT project, which deals with different aspects of interoperability in the Internet of Things (IoT). It aims at the design and implementation of an open framework and associated methodology to provide interoperability among heterogeneous IoT platforms, across a software stack (devices, network, middleware, application services, data and semantics). We focus on the data and semantics layer. Specifically, the role of ontologies and semantic data processing, as means of achieving interoperability. However, since the vision of the Semantic Web remains mostly unfulfilled, semantics remains implicitly ``hidden\'\' data and in exchanged messages. Therefore, we are particularly interested in establishing what methods and tools exist to create OWL ontologies from implicitly expressed semantics. We focus on popular data formats i.e. XML, JSON, RDF, Relational Databases and NoSQL Databases.","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/CCNC.2017.7983082","2017","222",NULL,NULL,"1","2018-10-01 22:05:51","Manually","","Pending","Waiting","0","1_1538445950","1"),
