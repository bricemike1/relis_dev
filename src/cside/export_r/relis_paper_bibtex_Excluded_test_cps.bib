It must be low energy consuming and highly reliable to deal with the simple but frequent interactions with the cloud, which constitutes the cloud-integrated CPS. Dynamic voltage scaling (DVS) has emerged as a critical technique to leverage power management by lowering the supply voltage and frequency of processors. In this paper, based on the DVS technique, we propose a novel Energy-aware Dynamic Task Scheduling (EDTS) algorithm to minimize the total energy consumption for smartphones, while satisfying stringent time constraints and the probability constraint for applications. Experimental results indicate that the EDTS algorithm can signi?cantly reduce energy consumption for CPS, as compared to the critical path scheduling method and the parallelism-based scheduling algorithm.

IN T RO D U C T IO N THE smartphone, as a typical cyberphysical system (CPS), gains increasing attention nowadays. With the popularity of embedded systems and the unprecedented development of high integrated chips, increasing functions are moving onto smartphones.Meanwhile, smartphones, as the most widely used mobile devices, are facing more severe challenges than others. The ever-increasing demands in rich interactive apps and service, such as location-based service, social networking service, mobile cloud service, and mobile information service, have severely aggravated the energy consumption problem for smartphones.Furthermore, to cater to public taste, manufacturers produce smartphones with increasing large-screen displays. That also increases the burden of batteries.Meanwhile, with the development of cloud computing, mobile cloud computing (MCC), which is a typical cloudintegrated CPS, becomes a new trend, which is using rich cloud Manuscript received February 2, 2015; revised May 1, 2015; accepted May 6, 2015.

  abstract = {Over the past few years semi-autonomous driving function-ality was introduced in the automotive market, and this trend continues towards fully autonomous cars. While in autonomous vehicles data from various types of sensors realize the new highly safety critical autonomous functionality, the already complex system architecture faces the challenge of designing highly reliable and safe autonomous driving system. Since sensors are prone to intermittent faults, using different sensors is better and more cost effective than duplicating the same sensor type because of diversity of reaction of different sensor typesto the same environmen-tal condition. Specifying and validating sensors and providing technical means that enable usage of data from different sensors in case of fail-ures is a challenging, time-consuming and error-prone task for engineers. Therefore, in this paper we present our model-based approach and a run-time system that improves the safety of autonomous driving systems by providing reusable framework managing different sensor setups in a ve-hicle in a case of a error. Moreover, the solution that we provide enables adaptive graceful degradation and reconfiguration by effective use of the system resources. At the end we explain in an example when and how the approach can be applied.},

A similar impact is expected on the design productivity of complex cyber-physical systems (CPS) if the challenges caused by heterogeneity of models and tools in design flows can be managed. This chapter examines the impact of heterogeneity on the composition and compositionality properties of models and tools and argues that new horizontal integration platforms for models, tools, and executions need to be developed to achieve progress. Using actual experience with developing an integrated design automation tool suite for vehicle power trains, OpenMETA, the chapter discusses the integration architecture and presents examples for a key component of the model and tool integration platforms, the OpenMETA Semantic Backplane.},

  abstract = {Abstract During the last 10 years, manufacturing companies have faced new challenges for improving their value proposition and being more efficient and effective on the market, satisfying the customer needs. According to this trend, several technologies have been developed and applied in different sectors and with different aims, in order to support such the companies in their reconfiguration. For example, the recent advances in Information and Communications Technologies (ICT) could give also to manufacturing industries the competences required to develop novel sustainable products embedded with a dedicated infrastructure able to provide more service functionalities to customer. In this context, the application of Internet of Things (IoT) have allowed developing the so named Product Service Systems (PSSs). Moreover, the cross-fertilization between such the technologies with the development of other ones have fostered the application of these novel ICT technologies inside the manufacturing companies also at process level. This approach has encouraged the study and development of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs). The present paper deals with a real industrial use case, where the application of ICT technologies and specifically the adoption of IoT at a plant of plastic extrusion pipes have allowed optimizing the production process in terms of energy efficiency.},
