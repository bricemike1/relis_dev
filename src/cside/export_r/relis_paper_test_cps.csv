It must be low energy consuming and highly reliable to deal with the simple but frequent interactions with the cloud, which constitutes the cloud-integrated CPS. Dynamic voltage scaling (DVS) has emerged as a critical technique to leverage power management by lowering the supply voltage and frequency of processors. In this paper, based on the DVS technique, we propose a novel Energy-aware Dynamic Task Scheduling (EDTS) algorithm to minimize the total energy consumption for smartphones, while satisfying stringent time constraints and the probability constraint for applications. Experimental results indicate that the EDTS algorithm can signi?cantly reduce energy consumption for CPS, as compared to the critical path scheduling method and the parallelism-based scheduling algorithm.

IN T RO D U C T IO N THE smartphone, as a typical cyberphysical system (CPS), gains increasing attention nowadays. With the popularity of embedded systems and the unprecedented development of high integrated chips, increasing functions are moving onto smartphones.Meanwhile, smartphones, as the most widely used mobile devices, are facing more severe challenges than others. The ever-increasing demands in rich interactive apps and service, such as location-based service, social networking service, mobile cloud service, and mobile information service, have severely aggravated the energy consumption problem for smartphones.Furthermore, to cater to public taste, manufacturers produce smartphones with increasing large-screen displays. That also increases the burden of batteries.Meanwhile, with the development of cloud computing, mobile cloud computing (MCC), which is a typical cloudintegrated CPS, becomes a new trend, which is using rich cloud Manuscript received February 2, 2015; revised May 1, 2015; accepted May 6, 2015.

MechatronicUML speci?cally targets the speci?cation of (i) a component-based software architecture, (ii) the real-time behavior of the components, and (iii) the recon?guration of the software architecture at run time. MechatronicUML distinguishes between platform-independent models (PIM) and platform-speci?c models (PSM) as de?ned by the modeldriven architecture approach 9. In this paper, we focus on the PIM level. In this section, we introduce the basic parts of the MechatronicUML component model 8,10 that are required for the contribution of this paper and refer to the given literature for a complete de?nition. The MechatronicUML component model enables to specify a component-based software architecture including the recon?guration of the software architecture at run time. In the remainder of this section, we ?rst review the speci?cation of components (Sect.2.1) and their instantiation to component instances (Sect.2.2).Thereafter, we describe the speci?cation of recon?gurations of the software architecture based on component story diagrams (Sect.2.3) and the de?nition of architectural constraints (Sect.2.4). Along with the component model, we also introduce the main parts of the RailCab model that we will use as a running example throughout the remainder of this paper. 2.1 Components ``A ..  component is a software element that conforms to a component model and can be independently deployed and composed without modi?cation according to a composition standard. '' 11, p.7 In accordance with UML 12, components are either implemented directly or assembled from other components, thereby forming a hierarchy of components. We refer to the former as atomic components and to the latter as structured components. In both cases, the internals of a component are hidden from the outside world. This is denoted as component encapsulation 1. Access to the capabilities or data of a component is only allowed via its ports.==========Heinzemann, Becker, Volk - 2017 - Transactional execution of hierarchical reconfigurations in cyber-physical systems - Your Highlight on page 1-1 | Added on Thursday, September 7, 2017 6:06:29 PMTransactional execution of hierarchical recon?gurations in cyber-physical systems Christian Heinzemann 1 \textperiodcentered Steffen Becker 2 \textperiodcentered Andreas Volk 3 Received: 15 March 2016 / Revised: 18 December 2016 / Accepted: 10 January 2017 \textcopyright Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2017 Abstract Cyber-physical systems recon?gure the structure of their software architecture, e.g. , to avoid hazardous situations and to optimize operational conditions like their energy consumption. These recon?gurations have to be safe so that the systems protect their users or environment against harmful conditions or events while changing their structure. As software architectures are typically built on components, recon?guration actions need to take into account the component structure. This structure should support vertical composition to enable hierarchically encapsulated components. While many recon?guration approaches for cyber-physical and embedded real-time systems allow the use of hierarchically embedded components, i.e. , vertical composition, none of them offers a modeling and veri?cation solution to take hierarchical composition, i.e. , encapsulation, into account thus limiting reuse and compositional veri?cation. In this paper, we present an extension to our existing modeling language, MechatronicUML, to enable safe hierarchical recon?gurations.

The disproportion between causes and effects highlights an emergent chaotic behaviour, traceable in the infrastructure complexity and level of interconnectedness.

Similarly, sustainable development has been defined as development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs, or basically as development under the sustainability constraints. Sustainability is presently seen as a delicate balance between the economic, environmental and social health of a community, nation and of course the Earth. The concept of sustainability, however, can be something more than just these three dimensions (namely: economy, society and the environment). These elements in fact, represent the external manifestations of sustainability because the internal, fundamental, and existential dimension isn't considered.

Several examples of exhibition systems can be found word wide. The management of these spaces, even in presence of a limited number of activities, requires significant efforts: safety, welcome, merchandising, public services, etc. Nowadays, the new trend is to offer multiple, contemporary use of exhibition spaces, allowing exhibition events and regular social activities (commercial, cultural, etc.) to be dynamically intertwined, either to endeavor the huge economic investments behind infrastructures or to increase the attractiveness of the exhibition activities. This is the case of ``Fiera del Levante'', one of the oldest exhibitions located in a fascinating central area on the seaside of the city of Bari - Italy. Here, multiple social scopes, such as multi-exhibitions and contemporary social activities related to public offices, restaurants and entertainment, live together. This is an almost unique setting, which makes Fiera del Levante (FdL) a complex system and makes the management of the exhibition a challenging co-management task. The paper deals with the development and demonstration of a complex-system modeling framework for the decision support of the co-management of Fiera del Levante exhibition system, taking into account the interaction both physical aspects (building assets, infrastructure, equipment, fittings, {\ldots}) and intangible aspects (permanent and temporary events, management and business activities, etc) and, of course, considering as a main input the needs of the different stakeholders involved.";2017

While in autonomous vehicles data from various types of sensors realize the new highly safety critical autonomous functionality, the already complex system architecture faces the challenge of designing highly reliable and safe autonomous driving system. Since sensors are prone to intermittent faults, using different sensors is better and more cost effective than duplicating the same sensor type because of diversity of reaction of different sensor typesto the same environmen-tal condition. Specifying and validating sensors and providing technical means that enable usage of data from different sensors in case of fail-ures is a challenging, time-consuming and error-prone task for engineers. Therefore, in this paper we present our model-based approach and a run-time system that improves the safety of autonomous driving systems by providing reusable framework managing different sensor setups in a ve-hicle in a case of a error. Moreover, the solution that we provide enables adaptive graceful degradation and reconfiguration by effective use of the system resources. At the end we explain in an example when and how the approach can be applied.";2014

According to this trend, several technologies have been developed and applied in different sectors and with different aims, in order to support such the companies in their reconfiguration. For example, the recent advances in Information and Communications Technologies (ICT) could give also to manufacturing industries the competences required to develop novel sustainable products embedded with a dedicated infrastructure able to provide more service functionalities to customer. In this context, the application of Internet of Things (IoT) have allowed developing the so named Product Service Systems (PSSs). Moreover, the cross-fertilization between such the technologies with the development of other ones have fostered the application of these novel ICT technologies inside the manufacturing companies also at process level. This approach has encouraged the study and development of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs). The present paper deals with a real industrial use case, where the application of ICT technologies and specifically the adoption of IoT at a plant of plastic extrusion pipes have allowed optimizing the production process in terms of energy efficiency.";2017
