It must be low energy consuming and highly reliable to deal with the simple but frequent interactions with the cloud, which constitutes the cloud-integrated CPS. Dynamic voltage scaling (DVS) has emerged as a critical technique to leverage power management by lowering the supply voltage and frequency of processors. In this paper, based on the DVS technique, we propose a novel Energy-aware Dynamic Task Scheduling (EDTS) algorithm to minimize the total energy consumption for smartphones, while satisfying stringent time constraints and the probability constraint for applications. Experimental results indicate that the EDTS algorithm can signi?cantly reduce energy consumption for CPS, as compared to the critical path scheduling method and the parallelism-based scheduling algorithm.

IN T RO D U C T IO N THE smartphone, as a typical cyberphysical system (CPS), gains increasing attention nowadays. With the popularity of embedded systems and the unprecedented development of high integrated chips, increasing functions are moving onto smartphones.Meanwhile, smartphones, as the most widely used mobile devices, are facing more severe challenges than others. The ever-increasing demands in rich interactive apps and service, such as location-based service, social networking service, mobile cloud service, and mobile information service, have severely aggravated the energy consumption problem for smartphones.Furthermore, to cater to public taste, manufacturers produce smartphones with increasing large-screen displays. That also increases the burden of batteries.Meanwhile, with the development of cloud computing, mobile cloud computing (MCC), which is a typical cloudintegrated CPS, becomes a new trend, which is using rich cloud Manuscript received February 2, 2015; revised May 1, 2015; accepted May 6, 2015.
