  year = {2015},
  abstract = {Over the last decade, interoperability appeared as a key enabler towards unlocking the full potential of enterprises, products, processes, and systems. With methods to support their lifecycle, contributing towards removing communication barriers, and fostering a new-networked business culture in industrial domains, Enterprise Interoperability (EI) requires tangible scientific foundations. This chapter recognizes that, in terms of content, any scientific field exists in an ecosystem of neighboring domains and presents a methodology to identify EI's relationship with its neighbors, thus supporting the foundations of EI Science Base (EISB). It can be agreed that formalisms like logic and mathematics are an integrant part of every science, but others also share relationships such as application fields' boundaries, methodologies, techniques, or even tools. With the support of the European Commission, through the Future Internet and Enterprise Systems (FInES) cluster of research projects, the authors have initiated an analysis of comprehensive domains (e.g. complexity and software). {\textcopyright} 2015 by IGI Global.

  title = {{An extensible modeling methodology for embedded and cyber-physical system design}},
  year = {2016},
  abstract = {Models are important tools to manage the increasing complexity of system design. The choice of a modeling language for constructing models governs what types of systems can be modeled, and which subsequent design activities can be performed. This is especially true for the area of embedded electronic and cyber-physical system design, which poses several challenging requirements of modeling and design methodologies. This article argues that the Formal System Design (ForSyDe) methodology with the necessary presented extensions fulfills these requirements, and thus qualifies for the design of tomorrow's systems. Based on the theory of models of computation and the concept of process constructors, heterogeneous models are captured in ForSyDe with formal semantics. A refined layer of the formalism is introduced to make its denotational-style semantics easy to implement on top of commonly used imperative languages, and an open-source realization on top of the IEEE standard language SystemC is presented. The introspection mechanism is introduced to automatically export an intermediate representation of the constructed models for further analysis/synthesis by external tools. Flexibility and extensibility of ForSyDe is emphasized by integrating a new timed model of computation without central synchronization, and by providing mechanisms for integrating foreign models, parallel and distributed simulation, modeling adaptive, data-parallel, and non-deterministic systems. A set of ForSyDe features is demonstrated in practice, and compared with similar approaches using a running example and two relevant case studies. {\textcopyright} Simulation Councils Inc.},

  year = {2018},
  abstract = {The adoption of Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) is regarded as an approach to reduce the accidental complexity of software systems development. The availability of sophisticated language workbenches facilitates the development of DSLs making them increasingly more popular. The adoption of DSLs at large comes at the risk that a poorly designed DSL can be too hard to adopt by its domain users. As such, Usability is one of the essential characteristics to mitigate this risk as it has an important impact on the productivity achieved by DSL users. The current state of practice in Software Language Engineering (SLE) neglects the Usability of DSLs. A pertinent research question in SLE is how to engineer Usability into DSLs systematically. We argue that a timely systematic approach based on User Interface experimental evaluation techniques should be used to assess the impact of DSLs during their development process, while the cost of fixing the usability problems is relatively small, when compared to fixing them at the end of the development process. For that purpose, we introduce a conceptual framework, called USE-ME, which supports the iterative incremental development process of DSLs concerning the issue of their Usability evaluation. We illustrate the feasibility of the approach on a case study of the development of a DSL meant for children to program robots. {\textcopyright} 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

  abstract = {Projectional editors are editors where a user's editing actions directly change the ABSTRACT syntax tree without using a parser. They promise essentially unrestricted language composition as well as flexible notations, which supports aligning languages with their respective domain and constitutes an essential ingredient of model-driven development. Such editors have existed since the 1980s and gained widespread attention with the Intentional Programming paradigm, which used projectional editing at its core. However, despite the benefits, programming still mainly relies on editing textual code, where projectional editors imply a very different-typically perceived as worse-editing experience, often seen as the main challenge prohibiting their widespread adoption. We present an experiment of code-editing activities in a projectional editor, conducted with 19 graduate computer-science students and industrial developers. We investigate the effects of projectional editing on editing efficiency, editing strategies, and error rates-each of which we also compare to conventional, parser-based editing. We observe that editing is efficient for basic-editing tasks, but that editing strategies and typical errors differ. More complex tasks require substantial experience and a better understanding of the abstract-syntax-Tree structure-then, projectional editing is also efficient. We also witness a tradeoff between fewer typing mistakes and an increased complexity of code editing.},

The proposed methodology discloses the opportunity of improving the cost-efficiency of the development process by providing automated support to identify viable design solutions with respect to selected non-functional requirements. To this end, it leverages the interplay of modeling languages for the vehicular domain whose integration is achieved by a suite of model transformations. An instantiation of the methodology is discussed for timing requirements, which are among the most critical ones for vehicular systems. To support the design of temporally correct systems, cooperation between EAST-ADL and the Rubus component model is opportunely built-up by means of model transformations, enabling timing-aware design and model-based timing analysis of the system. The applicability of the methodology is demonstrated as the proof of concepts on industrial use cases performed in cooperation with our industrial partners.},

However, these approaches can be applied to a wide variety of different model types and some of these models and associated transformations require different semantics than those popularised by current model transformation tools. Specifically, current relational model transformation languages typically prioritise matching relation patterns in the source model over creating a target model that is compliant with its meta-model. In this paper we describe a relational model transformation engine implemented as a series of Mixed Integer Linear Programs (MILP). This engine has a key novel feature; it prioritises target model compliance with its meta-model by considering multiple interpretations of applying the transformation specification in order to ensure a correct target model is generated. In this paper the MILP transformation engine and the representations it uses are described, followed by the results of applying it to examples of varying complexity. {\textcopyright} JOT 2011.},

Due to this complexity, these systems are typically developed in collaborative settings with stakeholders from different domains involved. A pertinent example is engineering of cyber-physical systems (CPS). Such collaborative endeavours are severely hindered by inconsistencies that arise due to semantic overlaps between different models. Additionally, since the involved domain-specific languages of stakeholders may be very disparate, inconsistencies often do not manifest on the linguistic level. To cope with this problem, we propose an approach that enables better understanding how inconsistencies arise, evolve and how they should be managed. The core of our approach is a rich process modeling formalism that allows modeling multiple aspects of the development workflow in accordance with the guidelines of multiparadigm modeling (MPM). We support our approach with an open-source prototype tool for designing engineering processes, defining inconsistency patterns and their respective management alternatives, and with the ability to optimize the original process for various optimality criteria, such as consistency and costs. {\textcopyright} 2016, CEUR-WS.

Early detection of inconsistencies results in more efficient processes, because it can reduce the amount of re-execution of costly engineering activities. In this paper, we propose an approach for early inconsistency detection in engineering processes. In our approach, the engineering process is explicitly modeled, along with the important characteristics and constraints of the system, imposed by the requirements and system specifications. This information is then used to enact the process and augment it with a run-time consistency monitoring service. Inconsistencies are expressed as a satisfiability problem of the constraints. Early detection of inconsistencies is achieved by monitoring the constraints, that is, checking their satisfiability at specific points of the process. Our approach is supported with a framework which includes a visual process modeling tool, a process enactment engine and a state-of-the-art symbolic solver for early inconsistency detection.},

  year = {2018},
  abstract = {Streaming model transformations represent a novel class of transformations to manipulate models whose elements are continuously produced or modified in high volume and with rapid rate of change. Executing streaming transformations requires efficient techniques to recognize activated transformation rules over a live model and a potentially infinite stream of events. In this paper, we propose foundations of streaming model transformations by innovatively integrating incremental model query, complex event processing (CEP) and reactive (event-driven) transformation techniques. Complex event processing allows to identify relevant patterns and sequences of events over an event stream. Our approach enables event streams to include model change events which are automatically and continuously populated by incremental model queries. Furthermore, a reactive rule engine carries out transformations on identified complex event patterns. We provide an integrated domain-specific language with precise semantics for capturing complex event patterns and streaming transformations together with an execution engine, all of which is now part of the Viatra reactive transformation framework. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach with two case studies: one in an advanced model engineering workflow; and one in the context of on-the-fly gesture recognition. {\textcopyright} 2016, The Author(s).},

  abstract = {Due to the increase of their complexity, currently engineered systems cannot be developed by one individual, but are a product of a collaboration between multiple stakeholders who develop the system from different domain-specific views. Inconsistencies between views, however, hinder collaboration and therefore, must be managed. Since the encountered inconsistencies may potentially disappear as the natural consequence of a design workflow, tolerating them to a given extent may be desirable and can lead to a more efficient collaboration. A key to reason about tolerance is the quantification of the impact of single inconsistencies on the overall system design. In this paper we present a quantification model for semantic inconsistencies in discrete and continuous systems. We investigate characteristic behavioral patterns of inconsistencies based on this model and identify the links with various forms of tolerance. Finally, we discuss the directions of further expanding the approach required for a comprehensive inconsistency tolerance technique.},

  abstract = {When a project is realized in a globalized environment, multiple stakeholders from different organizations work on the same system. Depending on the stakeholders and their organizations, various (possibly overlapping) concerns are raised in the development of the system. In this context a Domain Specific Language (DSL) supports the work of a group of stakeholders who are responsible for addressing a specific set of concerns. This chapter identifies the open challenges arising from the coordination of globalized domain-specific languages. We identify two types of coordination: technical coordination and social coordination. After presenting an overview of the current state of the art, we discuss first the open challenges arising from the composition of multiple DSLs, and then the open challenges associated to the collaboration in a globalized environment. {\textcopyright} Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

  year = {2017},
  abstract = {AUTOSAR (AUTomotive Open System ARchitecture) is an open and standardized automotive software architecture, developed by automobile manufacturers, suppliers, and tool developers. Its design is a direct consequence of the increasingly important role played by software in vehicles. As design choices during the software deployment phase have a large impact on the behavior of the system, designers need to explore various trade-offs. Examples of such design choices are the mapping of software components to processors, the priorities of tasks and messages, and buffer allocation. In this paper, we evaluate the appropriateness of DEVS, the Discrete-Event System specification, for modeling and subsequent performance evaluation of AUTOSAR-based systems. Moreover, a DEVS simulation model is constructed for AUTOSAR-based electronic control units connected by a communication bus. To aid developers in evaluating a deployment solution, the simulation model is extended with co-simulation with a plant and environment model, evaluation at different levels of detail, and fault injection. Finally, we examine how the simulation model supports the relationship between the supplier and the original equipment manufacturer in the automotive industry. We demonstrate and validate our work by means of a power window case study. {\textcopyright} Simulation Councils Inc.},

The process is based on the adoption of SysML as the system-level modeling language and the use of Simulink for the refinement of selected subsystems. Implementations are generated automatically for both the software (C++ code) and firmware parts, and communication adapters are automatically generated from SysML using a dedicated profile and open-source tools for modeling and code generation. The process starts from a SysML system model, developed according to the platform-based design paradigm, in which a functional model of the system is paired to a model of the execution platform. Subsystems are refined as Simulink models or hand-coded in C++. An implementation for Simulink models is generated as software code or firmware on FPGA. Based on the SysML system architecture specification, our framework drives the generation of Simulink models with consistent interfaces, allows the automatic generation of the communication code among all subsystems (including the HW\endashFW interface code). In addition, it provides for the automatic generation of connectors for system-level simulation and of test harnesses and mockups to ease the integration and verification stage. We provide early results on the time savings obtained by using these technologies in the development process. {\textcopyright} 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

In the last decade, the simulation of technical systems has leveraged graphical modeling and model-to-text transformations, but metamodeling and model transformation practices have not become widely accessible. Thereby, the benefits of employed model-driven approaches have been limited. System Entity Structures are directed labelled graphs that were proposed in the 1980s for specifying a family of system configurations for modular and hierarchical systems. The System Entity Structure and Model Base (SES/MB) framework combines the SES ontology with the classical workflow of modeling for an interactive or automatic generation of executable simulation models. After reviewing comparable approaches in software engineering, this paper discusses the application of SES/MB framework for metamodeling and model transformations for model-based engineering of simulations of technical systems. {\textcopyright}2017 Society for Modeling {\&} Simulation International (SCS).},

In this context, model transformations are crucial for the success of MDE, being comparable in role and importance to compilers for high-level programming languages. Thus, several model transformation approaches have been developed in the last decade, whereby originally most of them are based on the abstract syntax of modeling languages. However, this implementation specific focus makes it difficult for modelers to develop model transformations, because they are familiar with the concrete syntax but not with its computer internal representation. To tackle this problem, model transformation by-example approaches have been proposed which follow the same fundamental idea as query by-example and programming by-example approaches. Instead of using the computer internal representation of models, examples represented in concrete syntax are used to define transformations. Because different transformation scenarios occur in MDE, different by-example approaches have been developed. This chapter gives an overview on the emerging concepts, techniques, and approaches in this young by-example area. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

This ``roadmap'' paper prescribes an approach to modeling based on concurrent communicating components (called actors), where a diversity of orchestration strategies govern the execution and interaction of the components. The prescribed approach has been extensively explored in the Ptolemy Project, but as yet is not widely deployed in engineering practice. The approach achieves interaction between diverse models using an abstract semantics, which is a deliberately incomplete semantics that cannot by itself define a useful modeling framework. It instead focuses on the interactions between diverse models, reducing the nature of those interactions to a minimum that achieves a well-defined composition. The actor semantics is an abstract semantics that can handle many heterogeneous models that are built today, and some that are not common today. The actor abstract semantics and many concrete semantics are implemented in Ptolemy II, an open-source software framework.},

  abstract = {In a previous report, the ISPOR Task Force on Dynamic Simulation Modeling Applications in Health Care Delivery Research Emerging Good Practices introduced the fundamentals of dynamic simulation modeling and identified the types of health care delivery problems for which dynamic simulation modeling can be used more effectively than other modeling methods. The hierarchical relationship between the health care delivery system, providers, patients, and other stakeholders exhibits a level of complexity that ought to be captured using dynamic simulation modeling methods. As a tool to help researchers decide whether dynamic simulation modeling is an appropriate method for modeling the effects of an intervention on a health care system, we presented the System, Interactions, Multilevel, Understanding, Loops, Agents, Time, Emergence (SIMULATE) checklist consisting of eight elements. This report builds on the previous work, systematically comparing each of the three most commonly used dynamic simulation modeling methods - system dynamics, discrete-event simulation, and agent-based modeling. We review criteria for selecting the most suitable method depending on 1) the purpose - type of problem and research questions being investigated, 2) the object - scope of the model, and 3) the method to model the object to achieve the purpose. Finally, we provide guidance for emerging good practices for dynamic simulation modeling in the health sector, covering all aspects, from the engagement of decision makers in the model design through model maintenance and upkeep. We conclude by providing some recommendations about the application of these methods to add value to informed decision making, with an emphasis on stakeholder engagement, starting with the problem definition. Finally, we identify areas in which further methodological development will likely occur given the growing "volume, velocity and variety" and availability of "big data" to provide empirical evidence and techniques such as machine learning for parameter estimation in dynamic simulation models. Upon reviewing this report in addition to using the SIMULATE checklist, the readers should be able to identify whether dynamic simulation modeling methods are appropriate to address the problem at hand and to recognize the differences of these methods from those of other, more traditional modeling approaches such as Markov models and decision trees. This report provides an overview of these modeling methods and examples of health care system problems in which such methods have been useful. The primary aim of the report was to aid decisions as to whether these simulation methods are appropriate to address specific health systems problems. The report directs readers to other resources for further education on these individual modeling methods for system interventions in the emerging field of health care delivery science and implementation. {\textcopyright} 2015 Published by Elsevier Inc.},

  year = {2016},
  abstract = {CONTEXT. Software Product Lines (SPLs) aim to support the development of a whole family of software products through systematic reuse of shared assets. As SPLs exhibit a long life-span, evolution is an even greater concern than for single-systems. For the purpose of this work, evolution refers to the adaptation of the SPL as a result of changing requirements. Hence, evolution is triggered by requirement changes, and not by bug fixing or refactoring. OBJECTIVE. Research on SPL evolution has not been previously mapped. This work provides a mapping study along Petersen's and Kichenham's guidelines, to identify strong areas of knowledge, trends and gaps. RESULTS. We identified 107 relevant contributions. They were classified according to four facets: evolution activity (e.g., identify, analyze and plan, implement), product-derivation approach (e.g., annotation-based, composition-based), research type (e.g., solution, experience, evaluation), and asset type (i.e., variability model, SPL architecture, code assets and products). CONCLUSION. Analyses of the results indicate that ``Solution proposals'' are the most common type of contribution (31{\%}). Regarding the evolution activity, ``Implement change'' (43{\%}) and ``Analyze and plan change'' (37{\%}) are the most covered ones. A finer-grained analysis uncovered some tasks as being underexposed. A detailed description of the 107 papers is also included. {\textcopyright} 2016 Elsevier Inc.},

At the same time, the implementation of security counter-measures in such systems may impact other functional or non-functional concerns. In this context, we propose a model-based approach for securing critical systems at early design stage. This approach combines security analysis and mitigation solution proposals with multi-concern architectural evaluation. It exploits two views of security countermeasures patterns: abstract and concrete. The abstract view is used to select relevant solutions to security requirements on a logical point of view. Then, the concrete view helps the architect evaluating different possible implementation alternatives against other design constraints. The modeling is based on accepted OMG standards such as UML and MARTE. In this paper, the approach is illustrated on a SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) system case study and a tool chain based on Papyrus UML supports the approach. {\textcopyright} Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.},

  abstract = {Cyber-physical systems (CPS), which are computerized systems directly interfacing their real-world surroundings, leverage the construction of increasingly autonomous systems. To meet the high safety demands of CPS, verification of their behavior is crucial, which has led to a wide range of tools for modeling and verification of hybrid systems. These tools are often used in combination, because they employ a wide range of different formalisms for modeling, and aim at distinct verification goals and techniques. To manage and exchange knowledge in the verification process and to overcome a lack of a common classification, we unify different terminologies and concepts of a variety of modeling and verification tools in a conceptual reference model (CRM). Furthermore, we illustrate how the CRM can support comparing models and propose future extension. {\textcopyright} Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.},

  title = {{Towards a search-based interactive configuration of cyber physical system product lines}},
  year = {2013},
  abstract = {Product Line Engineering (PLE) is a technique to improve the quality and productivity of developing (via configuration) Cyber Physical Systems (CPSs). A CPS often contains many heterogeneous components with complex constraints relevant to product configuration in the context of PLE. Manual configuration is error-prone and has low productivity since managing and manipulating such constraints in a real industrial context is very complicated and thus warrants an automated solution. However, fully automated solution is often impossible for CPSs since some decisions must be made manually by users, thus requiring an interactive configuration solution. Therefore, we propose a semi-automated and interactive configuration solution for CPSs. We started our research by analyzing the characteristics of three industrial CPS product lines and constraints required for supporting such a configuration solution. Then we conducted some pilot experiments on applying search algorithms to find optimal decision orders for configuring a product. In this poster, we describe the whole research idea and, discsusion on the work we have completed, the initial results, and the future plan.},

Cyber-physical systems are heterogeneous systems, which require multi-disciplinary approach to their modelling. Modelling of cyber-physical systems by 2HMD approach gives an opportunity to transparently compose and analyse system components to be provided and components actually provided, and, thus, to identify and fill the gaps between desirable and actual system content.

  year = {2015},
  abstract = {Rigorous engineering of safety-critical Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) requires integration of heterogeneous modeling methods from different disciplines. It is often necessary to view this integration from the perspective of analyses - algorithms that read and change models. Although such analytic integration supports formal contract-based verification of model evolution, it suffers from the limitation of analytic dependency loops. Dependency loops between analyses cannot be resolved based on existing contract-based verification. This paper makes a step towards using rich architectural descriptions to resolve circular analytic dependencies. We characterize the dependency loop problem and discuss three algorithmic approaches to resolving such loops: analysis iteration, constraint solving, and genetic search. These approaches take advantage of information in multiview architectures to resolve analytic dependency loops.},

  abstract = {Model transformations are at the heart of model-driven engineering because they allow the automation of diverse kinds of model manipulations. Transformation scheduling is a key issue in the design and implementation of many transformation languages. This paper reports our results using continuations as the underlying technique for building a scheduling mechanism implicitly driven by data dependence among transformation rules. To support our experiments, we have built a proof-of-concept model transformation language, which is also reported here. First, we motivate the problem by analyzing the scheduling mechanism of current model transformation languages. Then, we introduce the notion of continuation, showing its applicability to model transformations. Afterwards, we present our approach, notably explaining how dependence is specified and giving the scheduling algorithm. We also analyze the lazy resolution of rules and how to deal with collection operations. The approach is validated by an implementation that targets the Java Virtual Machine and by running of the performance benchmarks that show its efficiency and scalability. Besides, we discuss how it can be applied to other existing transformation languages and present several applicability scenarios. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2013 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

  year = {2017},
  abstract = {Emergency response is a knowledge-intensive process that is very hard to model and automate. This primarily returns to the unpredictability and unrepeatability nature that characterises such process. Traditional modelling approaches are too rigid and do not effectively support the flexibility and dynamicity required by emergency response process. Case Management Model and Notation (CMMN) is a new standard modelling specification that has recently been released by Object Management Group (OMG) to standardise the modelling of Case Management approach. The objective of this study is to demonstrate how the CMMN can be used to model emergency response process. The authors use the CMMN to build a template model for a generic emergency response process. This model can easily be extended or interchanged among different modelling tools or execution platforms. In addition, they present a case study of a flood management process as a concrete example of using CMMN in modelling emergency response process. Finally, they conclude that the CMMN has a great potential to model case-based processes such as emergency response, but CMMN still in its infancy. As a result, there is a lack of mature modelling tools and execution engines to execute the CMMN models. {\textcopyright} The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2017.},

The history of Hardware-In-the-Loop (HIL) simulation and Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) are reviewed in the context of their respective roles in the development of complex engineered systems. The combination of HIL and MBSE is then proposed as a paradigm shift in the way design is performed, bringing valuable information early to the designer. However, there is much work to be done in understanding how to combine these two concepts and how to handle the information that would be generated. It is on the shoulders of both academia and industry to tackle different elements of this problem, as one entity acting alone will not effectively solve it. If history is a guide, industry will tend to linearly grow capabilities of existing toolsets to support existing customer bases. Academia will explore innovative approaches in the laboratory which may be of little practical use in industry. Research to determine the best way to integrate the total systems viewpoint and system effectiveness aspects of MBSE with the HIL simulation aspects of virtual HIL toolsets will bring those capabilities to bear jointly on complex engineered systems sooner and more effectively. {\textcopyright} 2016, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

This paper argues that an increased emphasis needs to be placed on the relations between viewpoints to be able to deal with the evolving scope and requirements on mechatronic products. We study relations between viewpoints at the levels of people, models and tools, and present solutions that are used to formally and explicitly capture such relations. Viewpoint contracts are used to define the vocabulary, assumptions and constraints required for ensuring smooth communication between stakeholders (people level). Dependency models capture relations between product properties belonging to different viewpoints, and how such dependencies relate to predictions and decisions (model level). Tool integration models describe the relations between tools in terms of traceability, data exchange, invocation and notifications (tool level). A major contribution of this paper is a unification approach, elaborating how these solutions can be used synergetically to integrate viewpoints. An industrial robot case study is utilized to illustrate the challenges and solutions with respect to relations between viewpoints, including the unification approach. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

  year = {2013},
  abstract = {The product race has become an innovation race, reconciling challenges of branding, performance, time to market and competitive pricing while complying with ecological, safety and legislation constraints. The answer lies in "smart" products of high complexity, relying on heterogeneous technologies and involving active components. To keep pace with this evolution and further accelerate the design cycle, the design engineering process must be rethought. The paper presents a mechatronic simulation approach to achieve this goal. The starting point is the current virtual prototyping paradigm that is widely adopted and that continues to improve in terms of model complexity, accuracy, robustness and automated optimization. Two evolutions are discussed. A first one is the extension to multi-physics simulation answering the design needs of the inherent multi-disciplinarity of "intelligent" products. Integration of thermal, hydraulic, mechanical, haptic and electrical functions requires simulation to extend beyond the traditional CAD-FEM approach, supporting the use of system, functional and perception models. The second evolution is the integration of control functions in the products. Where current industrial practice treats mechanical system design and control design as different design loops, this paper discusses their integration in a model-based design process at all design stages, turning concepts such as software-in-the-loop and hardware-in-the-loop into basic elements of an industrial design approach. These concepts are illustrated by a number of automotive design engineering cases, which demonstrate that the combined use of perception, geometric and system models allows to develop innovative solutions for the active safety, low-emission and high-comfort performance of next-generation vehicles. This process in turn poses new challenges to the design in terms of the specification and validation of such innovative products, including their failure modes and fault-tolerant behaviour. This will imply adopting a model-based system engineering approach that is currently already common practice in software engineering. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Author(s).},

  abstract = {The design of complex systems involves various, possibly heterogeneous, structural and behavioral models. In model-driven engineering, the coordination of behavioral models to produce a single integrated model is necessary to provide support for validation and verification. Indeed, it allows system designers to understand and validate the global and emerging behavior of the system. However, the manual coordination of models is tedious and error-prone, and current approaches to automate the coordination are bound to a fixed set of coordination patterns. In this paper, we propose a Behavioral Coordination Operator Language (B-COoL) to reify coordination patterns between specific domains by using coordination operators between the Domain-Specific Modeling Languages used in these domains. Those operators are then used to automate the coordination of models conforming to these languages. We illustrate the use of B-COoL with the definition of coordination operators between timed finite state machines and activity diagrams. {\textcopyright} 2015 IEEE.},

  year = {2015},
  abstract = {Software is not only difficult to create, but it is also difficult to understand. Even the authors themselves in a relatively short time become unable to readily interpret their own code and to explain what intent they have followed by it. Software is being created with the goal to satisfy the needs of a customer or directly of the end users. Out of these needs comes the intent, which is relatively well understandable to all stakeholders. By using other specialized modeling techniques (typically the UML language) or in the code itself, use cases and other high-level specification and analytical artifacts in common software development almost completely dissolve. Along with dedicated initiatives to improve preserving intent comprehensibility in software, such as literate programming, intentional programming, aspect-oriented programming, or the DCI (Data, Context and Interaction) approach, this issue is a subject of contemporary research in the re-revealed area of engaging end users in software development, which has its roots in Alan Kay's vision of a personal computer programmable by end users. From the perspective of the reality of complex software system development, the existing approaches are solving the problem of losing intent comprehensibility only partially by a simplified and limited perception of the intent and do this only at the code level. This paper explores the challenges in preserving the intent comprehensibility in software. The thorough treatment of this problem requires a number of techniques and approaches to be engaged, including preserving use cases in the code, dynamic code structuring, executable intent representation using domain specific languages, advanced UML modularization, 3D rendering of UML, and representation and animation of organizational patterns. {\textcopyright} 2015, Budapest Tech Polytechnical Institution.

The first is to give a comprehensive review of various service-oriented simulation frameworks to help researchers select the appropriate one for their specific purpose. The second goal is to combine the common features derived from the review into one unifying framework that can describe and prescribe various specific approaches. The focus of this paper is on the common functionalities of service-oriented simulations reflected in the review and unifying framework. In particular, we emphasize the way SOAs and M{\&}S are combined, and the interoperability and composability challenges of distributed M{\&}S services. We describe some fundamental concepts first. Then we present a comprehensive survey of several classical frameworks, including formalism-based, model-driven, interoperability protocol based, eXtensible Modeling and Simulation Framework (XMSF), Open Grid Services Architecture (OGSA) based, and ontology-driven frameworks. Based on the review, we propose a novel three-dimensional reference model that can unify the ad hoc approaches into a common framework. The model can be used as a guideline or an analytic means to find potential and possible future directions. In particular, the model inspects the crossover between the disciplines of M{\&}S, service-orientation, and software/systems engineering. Based on the model, we present a detailed comparison of the reviewed frameworks. Finally the significance of the paper is discussed and future directions are recommended. {\textcopyright} 2011, SAGE Publications. All rights reserved.},

To address the problem, this paper proposes a Physical Model Driven software Architecture for Internet of Things (PMDA), which supports the horizontal interconnections of physical applications. PMDA is composed of three models, namely, Physical Model, Sense-Execute Model and Application Model. The connections and interactions between models, and interactions among components in the models are realized by connectors, which satisfies some certain constraints. The composition of the three models in PMDA and the interactions among the models are formally described by an Architecture Description Language named Wright. The effectiveness of horizontal interconnections of physical applications based on PMDA is verified by PAT, in terms of deadlock-free, divergence-free and nonterminating. Besides that, those properties of IoT application systems developed under guidance of PMDA are proven by mathematical induction.},

  year = {2018},
  abstract = {Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) intrinsically combine hardware and physical systems with software and network, which are together creating complex and correlated interactions. CPS applications often experience uncertainty in interacting with environment through unreliable sensors. They can be faulty and exhibit runtime errors if developers have not considered environmental interaction uncertainty adequately. Existing work in verifying CPS applications ignores interaction uncertainty and thus may overlook uncertainty-related faults. To improve verification accuracy, in this article we propose a novel approach to verifying CPS applications with explicit modeling of uncertainty arisen in the interaction between them and the environment. Our approach builds an Interactive State Machine network for a CPS application and models interaction uncertainty by error ranges and distributions. Then it encodes both the application and uncertainty models to Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) formula to leverage SMT solvers searching for counterexamples that represent application failures. The precision of uncertainty model can affect the verification results. However, it may be difficult to model interaction uncertainty precisely enough at the beginning, because of the uncontrollable noise of sensors and insufficient data sample size. To further improve the accuracy of the verification results, we propose an approach to identifying and calibrating imprecise uncertainty models. We exploit the inconsistency between the counterexamples' estimate and actual occurrence probabilities to identify possible imprecision in uncertainty models, and the calibration of imprecise models is to minimize the inconsistency, which is reduced to a Search-Based Software Engineering problem. We experimentally evaluated our verification and calibration approaches with real-world CPS applications, and the experimental results confirmed their effectiveness and efficiency.},

  abstract = {Our objectives here are to discuss the development of a formal framework that exploits the advantages of the discrete event system specification (DEVS) formalism and builds upon recent extensive work on verification combining DEVS and model checking for hybrid systems. DEVS offers the ability, via mathematical transformations called system morphisms, to map a system expressed in a formalism suitable for analysis (e.g., timed automata or hybrid automata) into the DEVS formalism for the purpose of simulation. We discuss a probabilistic extension of the FD-DEVS formalism that enables a set of model classes and tools derived from Markov-type models. The MS4 modelling environment provides a suite of tools that support this extension, called FP-DEVS. In this paper, we describe these tools and the concepts underlying them. We also provide examples of application of these concepts and discuss the open opportunities for research in this direction. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2017 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

  title = {{Integration design and model transformation for cyber physical systems}},
  year = {2014},
  abstract = {Cyber physical system is hard to develop because developers need to consider functional properties, nonfunctional properties, such as timeliness, energy, memory, safety and reliability, dynamic continuous properties, spatial requirements and the interaction with physical world. In this paper, we propose an integrated approach to develop cyber physical systems based on multi-dimensions, multi-views and multi-paradigm. This model-integrated development approach addresses the development needs of cyber physical systems through the pervasive use of models. Model transformation is a central concept in model-driven development approaches and integration development approaches in cyber physical systems, as it provides a mechanism for automating the manipulation of models. We present the model transformation methods of cyber physical systems, we propose an approach to transform the models of AADL into the models of Modelica, and Modelica into AADL, clarify the transformation principles and to illustrate the important synergies resulting from the integration between these two languages.},
