MechatronicUML speci?cally targets the speci?cation of (i) a component-based software architecture, (ii) the real-time behavior of the components, and (iii) the recon?guration of the software architecture at run time. MechatronicUML distinguishes between platform-independent models (PIM) and platform-speci?c models (PSM) as de?ned by the modeldriven architecture approach [9]. In this paper, we focus on the PIM level. In this section, we introduce the basic parts of the MechatronicUML component model [8,10] that are required for the contribution of this paper and refer to the given literature for a complete de?nition. The MechatronicUML component model enables to specify a component-based software architecture including the recon?guration of the software architecture at run time. In the remainder of this section, we ?rst review the speci?cation of components (Sect.2.1) and their instantiation to component instances (Sect.2.2).Thereafter, we describe the speci?cation of recon?gurations of the software architecture based on component story diagrams (Sect.2.3) and the de?nition of architectural constraints (Sect.2.4). Along with the component model, we also introduce the main parts of the RailCab model that we will use as a running example throughout the remainder of this paper. 2.1 Components ``A [.. ] component is a software element that conforms to a component model and can be independently deployed and composed without modi?cation according to a composition standard. '' [11, p.7] In accordance with UML [12], components are either implemented directly or assembled from other components, thereby forming a hierarchy of components. We refer to the former as atomic components and to the latter as structured components. In both cases, the internals of a component are hidden from the outside world. This is denoted as component encapsulation [1]. Access to the capabilities or data of a component is only allowed via its ports.==========Heinzemann, Becker, Volk - 2017 - Transactional execution of hierarchical reconfigurations in cyber-physical systems - Your Highlight on page 1-1 | Added on Thursday, September 7, 2017 6:06:29 PMTransactional execution of hierarchical recon?gurations in cyber-physical systems Christian Heinzemann 1 {\textperiodcentered} Steffen Becker 2 {\textperiodcentered} Andreas Volk 3 Received: 15 March 2016 / Revised: 18 December 2016 / Accepted: 10 January 2017 {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2017 Abstract Cyber-physical systems recon?gure the structure of their software architecture, e.g. , to avoid hazardous situations and to optimize operational conditions like their energy consumption.

An increasing number of large-scale failures (effects), initiated by relatively small natural or man-made disturbances (causes), have brought unforeseen disruption to infrastructures in recent years. The disproportion between causes and effects highlights an emergent chaotic behaviour, traceable in the infrastructure complexity and level of interconnectedness. In order to quantify this complexity and emulate the behaviour of the infrastructure as it emerges from that of its components and their interaction, an object-oriented model is developed.},

  year = {2017},
  abstract = {Abstract An exhibition system is typically a physical open space made of several buildings devoted to performing demonstrations or social activities. Several examples of exhibition systems can be found word wide. The management of these spaces, even in presence of a limited number of activities, requires significant efforts: safety, welcome, merchandising, public services, etc. Nowadays, the new trend is to offer multiple, contemporary use of exhibition spaces, allowing exhibition events and regular social activities (commercial, cultural, etc.) to be dynamically intertwined, either to endeavor the huge economic investments behind infrastructures or to increase the attractiveness of the exhibition activities. This is the case of ``Fiera del Levante'', one of the oldest exhibitions located in a fascinating central area on the seaside of the city of Bari - Italy. Here, multiple social scopes, such as multi-exhibitions and contemporary social activities related to public offices, restaurants and entertainment, live together. This is an almost unique setting, which makes Fiera del Levante (FdL) a complex system and makes the management of the exhibition a challenging co-management task. The paper deals with the development and demonstration of a complex-system modeling framework for the decision support of the co-management of Fiera del Levante exhibition system, taking into account the interaction both physical aspects (building assets, infrastructure, equipment, fittings, {\ldots}) and intangible aspects (permanent and temporary events, management and business activities, etc) and, of course, considering as a main input the needs of the different stakeholders involved.},

Similarly, sustainable development has been defined as development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs, or basically as development under the sustainability constraints. Sustainability is presently seen as a delicate balance between the economic, environmental and social health of a community, nation and of course the Earth. The concept of sustainability, however, can be something more than just these three dimensions (namely: economy, society and the environment).
