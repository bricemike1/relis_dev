###################
ReLiS stands for "Revue Littéraire Systématique" which is French for "Systematic Literature Review". When a researcher wants to address a research problem, he starts by looking at what already exists in the scientific literature (published papers) on the topic. ReLiS is a tool that helps him considerably reduce the effort to analyze the corpus of papers, typically varying between hunderds and thousands depending on the research topic. ReLiS allows the user to follow a systematic process and automate the classification of papers as much as possible during the literature study.
